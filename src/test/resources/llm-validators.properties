# LLM Response Validator - TMS Agent Scope
# ===========================================
# This validator ensures AI Agent responses stay within the TMS domain.
# The agent should only assist with transportation management tasks:
# loads, drivers, trucks, trailers, and invoices.

# Validation Approach:
# Each response is checked to ensure it either:
# 1. Provides helpful TMS-related information
# 2. Offers assistance within TMS scope
# 3. Politely declines requests outside TMS domain

# TMS Domain Scope Definition
tms.scope.instruction=The TMS Agent should only respond to queries related to transportation management including loads, drivers, trucks, trailers, and invoices. For any question outside this scope, it should politely decline and redirect to TMS topics.

# Domain Keywords (response must relate to these or politely decline)
tms.domain.keywords=load,driver,truck,trailer,invoice,fleet,transportation,management,delivery,shipment,status,active,available,tms

# Decline Indicators (for out-of-scope responses)
tms.decline.keywords=only,cannot,unable,transportation management,tms related,outside,scope

# Minimum response length
tms.min.response.length=10

tms.agent.consistency.validator=Your job is to do the validation of two responses' consistency. Both of them should come consistent calculations, format, summary, and data.
